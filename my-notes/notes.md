While defining a function, use ":"instead of ";". REMEMBER THAT.  
    **erroring** Python seems always use ":" instead of ";" from C

### Note 1
What the hell is sys.argv[1:] from beer.py?And **Why On The Earth** it won't change anything?Can anyone explain that?  
OK I basiclly understand what the beer.py do. It has defind some variables and changed them one by one and output related sentenses. "if sys.argv[1:]: n = int(sys.argv[1])" is completely meanless and I still don't know what it means.
